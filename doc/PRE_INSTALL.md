### Important points to read before installing

- *Misskey* requires a dedicated root domain, e.g. `misskey.domain.tld` that can't be changed after installation
- *Misskey* can take quite some time to install, so take out some time and grab yourself a coffee.
- After installation, first page can take time to load and may show timeout error. Give it time to make itself ready for you. Refresh the page after 2 or 3 minutes.
- The first account created will be an admin user and will have all the admin rights.
